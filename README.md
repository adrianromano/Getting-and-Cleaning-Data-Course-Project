# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

**This is a course project for the coursera Getting and Cleaning Data project. The repository contains the following files:**

* run_analysis.R (the R script for the project)
* Codebook.md (a code book that explains the data variables and transformations on the project)
* tidydata.txt (output file for the end result of the project)

**The project involves the following steps to perform the analysis in run_analysis.R:**

1. Download the given source dataset and unzip it.
2. Load and read the datasets in R studio.
3. Merge the training and test sets into one single dataset. 
4. Subset only the columns of the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
5. Label the data set with descriptive variable names.
6. Create a second independent tidy data set with the average of variable for each activity and subject.
